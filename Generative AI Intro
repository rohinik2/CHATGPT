What is Generative AI ? 
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) describes algorithms (such as ChatGPT) that can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, 
text, simulations, and videos. Recent breakthroughs in the field have the potential to drastically change the way we approach content creation.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) refers to models or algorithms that create brand-new output, such as text, photos, videos, code, data, or 3D renderings, 
from the huge amount of data they are trained on. The models 'generate' new content by referring to the data they have been trained on, making new predictions.

Generative AI models use neural networks to learn patterns in data and generate new content. Once trained, the neural network can generate
content similar to the data it was trained on. For example, a neural network trained on a dataset of text can be used to generate new text,
and depending on the modelâ€™s input, the text output can take the form of a poem, a story, a complex mathematical calculation, or even programming code for software applications.
